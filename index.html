<a name="what-is-it" class="anchor" href="#what-is-it"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is it?</h2>

<p>Agent-based modelling is an analytic approach to discovering emergent behaviors in large groups by specifying simple rules to which individuals adhere.  Agent.js is intended to be a way to accomplish that in Javascript, automatically handling the things that are present in every model (like time, agents, controls and visualizations), and letting the coder/analyst concentrate on the <em>model</em>, not the code.</p>

<h2>
<a name="why-do-this" class="anchor" href="#why-do-this"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why do this?</h2>

<p>I learned Agent-Based Modelling using <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a>.  It was a great first-brush with the idea, but it has some pretty big deficiencies:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's based on the Logo Language, which is ancient and silly and no one actually uses.  I figured everyone and their dog learns some Javascript at some point, so it's a good alternative.</li>
<li>It compiles to Java Byte-code, which is itself a strength of the language.  However, that results in the primary packaging/presentation of models being Java applets.  Really?  It's 2013 and Java has no place in the browser.  I wanted to put the same kind of visualizations on a Canvas, and just use normal HTML form elements to control the model.</li>
<li>No one takes it seriously.  Ever tried to <a href="http://jobsearch.monster.com/search/?q=NetLogo">find a job</a> writing Netlogo code?  It's pretty slim pickin's.  My hope is that a newer approach which is more in-line with current software development practices will help spur along interest in the skill (Note to self: an ABM showing this would be a great demo).</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="current-capabilities" class="anchor" href="#current-capabilities"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Current Capabilities</h2>

<p>None.  This is still just a fledgling idea, probably years pre-alpha.</p>

<h2>
<a name="future-capabilities" class="anchor" href="#future-capabilities"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Future Capabilities</h2>

<ul>
<li>Three-line model development.  I claim that the simplest model should need no more than three lines to implement, and the library should handle the rest.</li>
<li>I'd like to integrate an Open-Source 3D JavaScript rendering engine to enable 3D modeling, but that's just a pipe-dream for now.</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="help-me" class="anchor" href="#help-me"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Help Me!</h2>

<p>This project is a big idea.  I'm but a single, modest web developer.  If you dig the idea, jump in and help me out.  I'll look at whatever merge requests you send.</p>
