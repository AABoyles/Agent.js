{"name":"Agent.js","tagline":"A Backbone-powered framework for constructing Agent-Based Models using pure Javascript.","body":"Agent.js is Copyright 2013, [Tony Boyles](mailto:AABoyles@gmail.com)\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n-----------\r\nAgent-based modelling is an analytic approach to discovering emergent behaviors in large groups by specifying simple rules to which individuals adhere.  Agent.js is intended to be a way to accomplish that in Javascript, automatically handling the things that are present in every model (like time, agents, controls and visualizations), and letting the coder/analyst concentrate on the _model_, not the code.\r\n\r\nWhy do this?\r\n------------\r\nI learned Agent-Based Modelling using [NetLogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).  It was a great first-brush with the idea, but it has some pretty big deficiencies:\r\n* It's based on the Logo Language, which is ancient and silly and no one actually uses.  I figured everyone and their dog learns some Javascript at some point, so it's a good alternative.\r\n* It compiles to Java Byte-code, which is itself a strength of the language.  However, that results in the primary packaging/presentation of models being Java applets.  Really?  It's 2013 and Java has no place in the browser.  I wanted to put the same kind of visualizations on a Canvas, and just use normal HTML form elements to control the model.\r\n* No one takes it seriously.  Ever tried to [find a job](http://jobsearch.monster.com/search/?q=NetLogo) writing Netlogo code?  It's pretty slim pickin's.  My hope is that a newer approach which is more in-line with current software development practices will help spur along interest in the skill (Note to self: an ABM showing this would be a great demo).\r\n\r\nCurrent Capabilities\r\n--------------------\r\nNone.  This is still just a fledgling idea, probably years pre-alpha.\r\n\r\nFuture Capabilities\r\n-------------------\r\n* Three-line model development.  I claim that the simplest model should need no more than three lines to implement, and the library should handle the rest.\r\n* I'd like to integrate an Open-Source 3D JavaScript rendering engine to enable 3D modeling, but that's just a pipe-dream for now.\r\n\r\nHelp Me!\r\n--------\r\nThis project is a big idea.  I'm but a single, modest web developer.  If you dig the idea, jump in and help me out.  I'll look at whatever merge requests you send.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n    Agent.js is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    Agent.js is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
